                    <h2>Michigan Travel Tips</h2>
                    <p><strong>Choose the best time for your trip to Michigan:</strong> The very best time to visit Michigan is September and October. September is like a second summer, and October has the best of the autumn weather. June through August are tremendously beautiful, but with kids out of school, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a campground to yourself, which isn’t a problem after Labor Day.</p>
                    <p><strong>Winter in southern Michigan:</strong> Winter in southern Michigan is unpredictable and with climate change, leans toward dwindling. You will, though, absolutely be astonished by the snow in the UP.</p>
                    <p><strong>Natural disasters:</strong> Michigan has one of the nation’s lowest rates of natural disasters.</p>
                    <p><strong>Carhartt’s Workwear:</strong> Carhartt’s Workwear has also become a fashion statement across the state.</p>
